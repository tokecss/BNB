# BNB_Crack
Using the cluster module to create numerous worker processes, the BNB Bruteforce Node.js script generates random BNB keypairs and checks to see if the public address corresponding to the private key is in a Set of full addresses from data.txt.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1. Edit file data.txt in the same directory as the script and add the BNB addresses you want to search for, one per line start with 0x. (Like 3 exmples included)
2. Run node app.js to start the script.
3. The script will display the loop count and keys generated per minute for each worker process.
4. The Script look for a FULL address from data.txt
5. If a match is found, the script will save the wallet and its private key (seed) to a file named match.txt and exit.

Keep in mind that a Windows app wonâ€™t speed up searching or guarantee success.
